# snippets
Code is written in c++.
In these snippets, I am interacting with ESP boards, primarily ESP8266 and ESP32. The type of board I am interacting with 
will be clearly stated in the title of the file. 

Additionally, diagrams of my setup are included in each folder (if necessary). Those folders that do not include a 
diagram include pinouts at the very top of the .ino file.
